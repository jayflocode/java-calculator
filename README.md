Java Calculator Project

This is a Java calculator project using a Jframe GUI. Details of the JFrame type can be seen
in the MyFrame class. This code uses a Grid-Bag layout to assemble a simple and easy to use calculator.
An action button listener is implemented to record the values in strings, and store these values according
to how the arithmetic is being inputed. 

If you examine the source files you fill find that this Java project makes a use of MX Parser which is used to evaluate, and compute the String expressions. This Parser is useful since it is able to evaluate a full expression from a Strings, and represent the values as a String. In other words,
this calculator does not make a usage of Integers, or Doubles. 

The code is going to be improved in the next couple of weeks to add some extra functionalities, and perhaps will be seeing 
the code imported into a mobile platform such as Android OS.
